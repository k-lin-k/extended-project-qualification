    <h1>Grace Murray Hopper</h1>
    <p>Grace Murray Hopper, who worked 
        on multiple major projects in the U.S. Navy and received a Presidential
        Medal of Freedom posthumously. Like the female computers, she was first 
        a wartime mathematician, with a PhD from Yale. During her earlier years
        in the Navy, she was part of the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project, 
        becoming one of the first to program the Mark I computer, which was a 
        major part of the Manhattan project. As WWII came to an end, she subsequently 
        worked on the Mark II and III, influencing the adoption of hardware 
        features such as conditional branching, fundamental to the core logic
        of computer science. Funnily, she is also related to the birth of the 
        computing lingo “bug”, as the team discovered a moth to be the cause of
        the machine malfunctioning. Hopper’s journey did not stop here; in 1949, 
        she oversaw programming for the first commercial electronic computer, the
        UNIVAC. She produced the first high-level programming language and its 
        associated compiler despite scepticism, realising the UNIVAC’s potential 
        in its ability to perform general computational tasks. Her technical vision 
        “regularly preceded hardware capabilities” and is named a pioneer in the use 
        of computing by Dr Robin Burk, a title she deserves.
