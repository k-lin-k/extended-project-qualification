        <h1>Female "Computers" of World War II</h1>
        <p>Computing was a brand new discipline that emerged with an overwhelming 
            demand for military calculations, just less than a century ago - whether 
            it’s predicting ballistic trajectories or deciphering Nazi communication, 
            a call for increased efficiency rose with war. Nowadays, people are unaware 
            that the word “computers” originally described people who performed mathematical
            calculations. During World War II, in the primal stage of computing pre-electronic 
            computers, the overwhelming majority of “computers” were women who calculated
            bombsight indices and ballistics data as the men headed to the frontline.
            Female computers in the United States held degrees in mathematics and 
            worked with complex differential equations; they calculated with comptometers
            and slide rules, and often worked shifts that lasted for days in order to 
            deliver the data needed for operations on time. As I researched specifics 
            of the women computers’ work, I realised they often did not receive as much 
            recognition as their male counterparts, despite how essential their work was 
            to the advancement of military computing, and ultimately, the development of 
            modern electronic computers. <br><br>
            
            In the documentary “Top Secret Rosies”, personal 
            accounts from the women were first heard decades after their work. One of the female 
            computers gave a detailed account of her work post-war, which proved to be even more
            crucial to the evolution of computing - Jean Jennings Bartik and 
            her twin sister Betty were invited to program instructions for the first electronic 
            computer, ENIAC. They were invited to the project for the abundant experience 
            from their human computer days; however, their work was considered clerical and 
            trivial, and many expected to be able to separate the machines from their human 
            programmers. These early arguments severely underestimated the
            importance of software, especially since debugging was (and is) inseparable from the 
            machine’s ability to function. Eventually, S. Frankel and N. Metropolis started using the 
            computer for the development of nuclear weapons, and it was the women who familiarised
            them with the machine. In the heat of the nuclear race, Bartik and her sister 
            “worked night and day” to prepare for a demonstration of the trajectory with the
            computer; the success of such programs received publicity, and they were
            undeniably the backbone of the project. Unfortunately, despite their unequivocal contributions, female computers 
            were not invited to the celebration dinner, and their photographs did not 
            appear in the press - the military had posed for very specific images to be
            released.<br><br>

            This lack of recognition hindered the public’s understanding of the 
            role women played in the foundation of computing, despite the irreplaceable
            nature of their work. Much of the credit for modern computing is given to 
            the founders of modern computing in WWII, e.g. Sir Alan Turing, but the public often forgets it couldn't happen
            without the programmers and mathematicians behind the scenes. Those "computers", who were often 
            female, were also a driving force of the rapid advancements. Fortunately, the importance
            of women in computing gained a rise of recognition just recently, with the 
            release of the film Hidden Figures in 2016, adapted from the homonymous book.
            We need to know and remember that here were even more women who worked behind the stars of the film, 
            with similar stories waiting to be found. As the author of Hidden Figures, Margot Lee
            Shetterly, says, “you can’t say women weren’t interested in computing. History 
            shows us that is not true.”
