<h1>Computer Science</h1>
<p>
    Computing in the modern era carries the stereotype of being a male-dominated field, by 
    natural talent; in fact, it was only when computers became viewed as more than office machines that
    computing became men’s work. With the past contributions
    of women (at a time of equal involvement) being of such significance, girls and
    women should be given more opportunities to engage in the same way, since much of their potential is 
    currently going into waste. Further involvement of women should be encouraged as it would 
    bring in more innovation crucial to further advancements as a joint effort of humanity. Julie A. James of 
    Swinburne University of Technology argues that there is evidence to suggest that a typically feminine approach
    to management in this desired new environment may prove highly successful. From technical, philosophical
    and sociological standpoints, women’s involvement is undeniably crucial to the development 
    of computing.<br><br>

    Girls, here are some reasons you should consider computer science:
    <ul style="max-width:400px;">
        <li>CS in history: there were more opportunities for the female "computers" post-war, compared to the average women who returned to the domestic sphere</li>
        <li>You get to do fulfilling work that is constantly influencing the world</li>
        <li>High wage: the average computer science graduate makes over £30,000/year, compared to the national average of around £24,000</li>
      </ul>
    etc.<br><br>

    I have listed some resources that could serve as introduction to programming:

<h3>Resources:</h3><br><a href="https://www.turtle.ox.ac.uk/">The Turtle System</a><br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>
</p>
<p>My very first program was an animation made with scratch. Before doing A-level computer Science, I found scratch to be very
    helpful with learning underlying computer science logic. The turtle system is a post-scratch bridging system that supports
    code, with immediate visual feedback.<br><br>

    I'd like to encourage more girls to get into computing; I made this site with this aim and
    hope your visit had been inspiring. The scratch-like way of accessing biographies here demands no technical knowledge
    and was designed with the intention of lessening intimidation on reading into the subject. At 
    the same time, the pseudocode “print” function in the interface would hopefully serve as a gateway to tech
    for beginners. This website was built from scratch by myself, with research from textbook resources
    to realise the technicality. I hope this artefact is a small step in the right direction for the better 
    advancement of computing, shedding some light on the inspirational female figures.<br><br>

    Disclaimer: I am not a TERF; the frequent use of "female" is purely for convenience. Girls, boys and non-binary folks, check out CS for yourselves!
