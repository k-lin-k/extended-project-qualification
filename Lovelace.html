    <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
    <p>Ada Lovelace is widely recognised as the world's first computer programmer. An avid translator, 
        she had translated many mathematical papers into English. 
        In 1843, she published a translation of Menabra's paper on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, 
        the first (theoretical) computer created; this translation featured her notes, thrice as 
        long as the original, and proposed a program to compute the Bernoulli numbers on this machine.
        Technically, it may not be completely accurate to call her the first programmer, although her program is the first to be well known;
        Babbage was likely the first to write programs for his machine. However, her notes and program were crucial
        as it was much more complex and ambitious than Babbage’s initial visions, with the work being implicit 
        - all done by the engine without the need for human calculations. The program Lovelace wrote demonstrates 
        conditional branching and loops, which are concepts still relevant in modern computing. It
        was an impressive feat with amazing prescience, having been written long before
        the rapid development of computing as we know it today. On top of this, Ada’s 
        work ended up becoming the only such paper discussing programming of computers
        for the next century. Her work proved to be influencial, decades and even centuries after 
        her death; she famously argued that machines cannot think, as they 
        are only able to do what we know how to order them to do. Alan Turing echoed 
        this sentiment, dubbing it “Lady Lovelace’s Objection”. She publicised theories of programming in the 
        very primal stages of both physical and conceptual computing, and can undoubtedly be dubbed as one of the founders
        of computer science. <br><br>

        Her status in the history of computing does not go without doubt; Dorothy Stein, her greatest critic, even doubts
        the authenticity of her authorship.
        Upon investigating Stein’s writing on Lovelace, I found much of this critism and invalidation 
        to be flawed; she argues that Babbage’s attitude towards Lovelace’s theories 
        was negative, and his flattering letters were only an act of politeness. Yet, he
        has no reason to flatter her, if she was really someone of “little natural talent” as Stein claims. 
        Babbage even mentions in a letter that Lovelace “detected a grave mistake which
        [he had] made” in computing the Bernoulli numbers, proving her competency in the 
        theories. Stein believes that Lovelace was unpractical with her philosophical views, 
        but without those blocks as the foundation, how could Lovelace have such foresight and continue to have 
        her work influence millions?</p>
