    <p>Ironically, the person most widely recognised as the first computer programmer 
        is a woman. This title is often dubbed to Ada Lovelace, who wrote a program to 
        compute Bernoulli numbers in her Notes on Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. 
        Technically, it may not be completely accurate to call her the first programmer;
         Babbage was likely the first to write programs for his machine. This is not to say
          that her work is any less crucial; it was much more complex and ambitious than 
          Babbage’s initial visions, with the work being implicit - all done by the engine 
          without the need for human calculations. The program Lovelace wrote demonstrates 
          conditional branching and loops, concepts still relevant in modern computing. It
           was an impressive feat with amazing prescience, having been written long before
            the rapid development of computing as we know it today. On top of this, Ada’s 
            work ended up becoming the only such paper discussing programming of computers
             for the next century. She famously argued that machines cannot think, as they 
             are only able to do what we know how to order them to do. Alan Turing echoed 
             this sentiment, dubbing it “Lady Lovelace’s Objection”. An avid translator, 
             she had translated many mathematical papers into English, whilst publishing 
             her notes as well; With this, she publicised theories of programming in the 
             very primal stages of both physical and conceptual computing. <br><br>
             
             Her status in the history of computing is not without doubt; some even question 
             the authorship of her papers, with Dorothy Stein being her greatest critic. 
             Still,
             Upon 
             investigating Stein’s writing on Lovelace, I found much of her invalidation 
             to be flawed; she argues that Babbage’s attitude towards Lovelace’s theories 
             was negative, and his flattering letters were only an act of politeness; yet he
              has no reason to flatter someone of “little natural talent” as Stein claims. 
              Babbage even mentions in a letter that Lovelace “detected a grave mistake which
               I have made” in computing the Bernoulli numbers, proving her competency in the 
               theories. Stein believes Lovelace was unpractical with her philosophical views, 
               but without those blocks as the foundation, 
               how could “prophets” like Lovelace and Hopper have such foresight?</p>
